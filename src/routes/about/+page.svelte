	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>
		Starter Kit is a SvelteKit starter template with authentication, routing, and more. As a
		SvelteKit app, it's built with the latest SvelteKit features and best practices with Typesafety
		built in.
	</p>

	<p>
		We use Daisy UI for styling, which is a Tailwind CSS component library. It's a great way to get
		started with a beautiful, accessible, and responsive design. Bits-UI is also included for making
		Daisy UI components more accessible and responsive since Daisy UI is not fully accessible due to
		being limited to CSS only.
	</p>

	<p>
		The Database is a Sqlite database with a Drizzle ORM. You can customize the database to use any
		other database like Postgres, MySQL, or MongoDB.
	</p>

	<p>Btw, this page was pre-rendered at build time.</p>
